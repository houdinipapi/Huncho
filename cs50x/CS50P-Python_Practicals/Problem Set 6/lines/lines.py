"""
- Implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument,
the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file,
excluding comments and blank lines.
- If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument,
or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py,
or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
- Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment.
(A docstring should not be considered a comment.)
Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
